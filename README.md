## Project Description

User can search and filter used cars without knowing the vin number. For example, people had to know VIN numbers for cars they are interested and search them in the VIN history lookup websites if they wanted to buy cars with only one previous owner. With this program, users can set the filter to one previous owner to search for them and get the details without knowing the VIN numbers. The automated system will update the database daily for users to fetch a fresh list of available used cars.
